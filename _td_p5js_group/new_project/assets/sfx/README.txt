### SOURCE NOTE ###

> THESE SOUNDS ARE FROM THE VIDEO GAME "COMMAND AND CONQUER, RED ALERT 1" AND IS (C) WESTWOOD STUDIOS (NOW OWNED BY ...UGH... ELECTRONIC ARTS).
> I OWN A PHYSICAL DISK OF THIS GAME (IT'S IN MY CLOSET, SOMEWHERE) AND THE SOUNDS WERE EXTRACTED VIA THE 'XCC AV PLAYER' UTILITY APP.
> THESE SOUNDS ARE USED HEREIN FOR SFX PURPOSES. THIS PROJECT IS NON-PROFIT/OPEN-SOURCE.
> IF EA HAPPENS TO BE PETTY ENOUGH TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS:
    1) HAVE AN OFFICIAL I.E. VERIFIED/VERIFYABLE ACCOUNT POST AN ISSUE STATING THEREOF TO THIS REPO; THEN
    2) I'LL PULL THEM AND LIKELY REPLACE WITH MY OWN NARRATOR VOICE SAYING ANALOGOUS THINGS; VIA
    4) USING FREE TEXT-2-SPEECH SERVICE FOR RAW VOICE, THEN POST-PROCESSING IT IN AUDACITY TO SOUND ROBOT-LIKE
> BUT DON'T BE PETTY, EA... ESPECIALLY AS GIVEN YOUR QUALITY AND SALES: ONE COULD SOON BUY THE IP RIGHTS TO THE CLASSIC C&C SERIES FOR PENNIES.
