# PROJECT-BROADGATE
Project Broadgate: Sharing and Demoing my various Creative Coding, Visualization, and Sim/Game Development Projects

## Link:

Most of the projects within this directory are implemented as live interactive demos which are listed (with descriptions and links to each demo) via the 'Coding Projects' page at my GitHub homepage [(linked here)](https://seiselen.github.io/codingProjects.html).

## Description:

The following were made as small[er] standalone interactive code demos and/or visualizations for the purpose of being interacted with via the browser as 'toys', but toys for which the source code that implements them could also be studied. Most originate from projects that I originally implemented in the Processing Environment (Java), but refactored into P5JS (JavaScript/HTML); as the latter allows me to easily host live demos via their GitHub pages link. Suffice to say: it's awesome that GitHub supports this capability!

### 1/3/22 Content Addendum:

Also in this directory (though with no 'playable' links or pages on my GH homepage [yet] provided) are several projects related to both 'TD-P5JS' (i.e. Tower Defense in P5JS) and 'ZAC' (a.k.a. Zed Alert which is my homebrew 'Survival Horror RTS' game). They are planned to be relocated to separate repos at some point; but whether or not this actually happens is currently TBD and lower on the TODO/priority list.
