IDEA:
 > IMPLEMENT 'USER-PAINTS-POLYGON' (STRAIGHT LINES ONLY)
 > GENERATE VERTICES THROUGHOUT CANVAS AND THEN GENERATE VD VIA VERTS, PER-USUAL
 > IDENTIFY 'IN-POLY BORDER CELLS' AS: {VERT WHICH IS WITHIN POLYGON[S] AND WHOSE VD CELL SHARES BORDER WITH VERT NOT WITHIN POLYGON[S]}
    o THIS TRIVIALLY PROVIDES THE OTHER THREE KINDS, AS FOLLOWS:
    o 'OUT-POLY BORDER CELLS': ALL UNIQUE VERTS WHOSE CELLS ARE NOT WITHIN POLYGON[S] AND WHICH SHARE BORDER WITH VERT WHICH IS THEREWITHIN
    o 'INTERIOR CELLS': SET DIFFERENCE OF 'IN-POLY CELLS' SANS 'IN-POLY BORDER CELLS'.   <= THESE ALWAYS ENCOMPASS TERRAIN (BORDERS MAY OR MAY NOT)
    o 'EXTERIOR CELLS': SET DIFFERENCE OF 'OUT-POLY CELLS' SANS 'OUT-POLY BORDER CELLS'. <= VERY IMPORTANT! THESE ARE WHAT CAN BE IMMED. DISREGARDED
 > SO PRUNE OUT ALL 'EXTERIOR CELLS' (MAYBE ALL OUT-POLY BORDERS TOO), ANY IN-POLY BORDERS WHICH ARE 'AWKWARD', AND MAYBE SMOOTH CELLS + SNAP VERTS?

YOU'RE ALSO REALIZING A CHUNK OF 'COBBLESTONE':
 > CAN USE DELAUNAY ESSENCE OF VERTS TO DEFINE MATERIAL TYPES, AS FOLLOWS...
 > INIT SET OF VERTS ARE {EXPLOSION SITE, BULLET, ETC.} CORRESP. TO SOME ACTION WHICH EFFECTS/ENCOMPASSES PCG DEST. TERRAIN
 > THEREOF, SECONDARY SET OF VERTS GENERATED WHICH ENCOMPASS 'STRESSORS' THAT DEFINE HOW DECOMPOSITION OCCURS; EXAMPLES:
    o BULLETPROOF GLASS: DENSELY PACKED CLUSTER OF SECONDARY POINTS, PERHAPS INCREASING CONTOURS OUT, WHEREFROM VD IS GENERATED
    o WEAK GLASS: EQUIDISTANTLY DISTRIBUTED VERTS (MAYBE 1/2 OF AVERAGE DIST BETWEEN INIT SET?) ENCOMPASSING EQUALLY-SIZED SHARDS, WHEREFROM "..."
    o EXPL CHARGE IN GRANITE: SIMILAR TO BULLETPROOF BUT IN 3D - RESULTING DEFORMATION ENCOMPASSES SMALL BUT HIGHLY-COMPRESSED VOID, WHEREFROM "..."
    o EXPL CHARGE IN MUD: DENSELY PACKED CLUSTERS OF SECONDARY POINTS, BUT NOT VIA INCREASING CONTOURS, WHEREFROM "..."
    o ETC. ETC. YOU GET ZEEE IDEA!
